                    </div>

                    <p><a href="http://www.kijiji.ca">Kijiji</a>, an eBay company, is Canada’s leading classifieds
                        site and the 2nd most reputable web and social media brand in Canada after Google**. On
                        average, half of Canadians visit Kijiji each month. In September 2016, Kijiji received 15.3M
                        visitors, or 50% of the Canadian digital population. These figures give an idea of the kind
                        of scale the website needs to be capable of handling.
                    </p>

                    <p>Kijiji's tech department consists of several cross functional squads. The squad (known as
                        KIA) I was apart of focussed on development for Kijiji’s commercial revenue streams across
                        all verticals (real estate, autos, jobs, etc.). This included Admarkt, display and text
                        advertising, integations with third partiy vendors (for example Indeed), and any other
                        revenue generating initiatives.</p>

                    <p>The squad was made up of 3 backend engineers (including myself), 1 frontend engineer, a squad
                        development lead, 1 QA engineer, a product manager and a delivery (project) manager. As part
                        of my role within the team I was responsible for contributing to the design and development
                        of product features and subsystems. After my first year in the company, I was promoted to
                        take on a more senior role where I was entrusted with owning initiatives from the design
                        stage all the way to production and thereafter. One example of this is Kijiji's automobile
                        'New Car' feature. </p>

                    <h4>Admarkt</h4>
                    <p>Admarkt is Kijiji's new cost-per-click advertising platform intended for Business Sellers. It
                        is a completely new way of users operating their business on Kijiji, where instead of paying
                        for features on the fly to boost their business, everything is now based off an ad level
                        budget. Some of my contributions include the initial rollout strategy across Canada, some of
                        the power features (bulk inventory ingestion and expedited account creation) and the
                        integration with our existing user moderation workflows.</p>

                    <p>MTT are a software company (more recently acquired by Travelport Digital) that specialize in
                        mobile apps, mobile web and mobile technology products for airlines, travel management
                        companies, OTAs and hotels. They have customers such as: EasyJet, Saudia Airlines, Singapore
                        Airlines, BCD, and LATAM.</p>

                    <h4>Concierge Live</h4>

                    <p>MTT Concierge Live is a real-time mobile travel assistant that obtains a passenger's relevant
                        trip information in order to provide guidance through every step of the journey. Concierge

                    <p>MTT's product team is responsible for building all the core tooling, components and services
                        that make up MTT's products. These services have to be very robust and extensible, as they
                        are used across different solutions for clients with different needs. This meant that code
                        reviews, architecture/design sessions, and pair programming played a large role in our
                        development processes. My main responsibility for Concierge Live was building, configuring
                        and maintaining Spring Boot web services. Some of the main technologies used were Groovy,
                        Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, Cucumber, Thymeleaf and MongoDB.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a> is an automation platform used to provide
                            provisioning,
                            deployment and configuration
                            management capabilities. Ansible provides functionality through scripts called
                            <i>playbooks</i>.
                        </p>
                        In Ansible terms, a playbook is a list of <i>plays</i> where each <i>play</i> must contain:

                        <ul>
                            <li>A set of hosts (remote server instances) to configure</li>
                            <li>An ordered list of tasks to be executed on those hosts</li>
                        </ul>

                        As part of my role at MTT, I used Ansible to:

                        <h2>Dissertation Telemedicine application</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p>The following is taken from the abstract section of my dissertation:</p>
                    <blockquote><i>"Telemedicine is an important practice that removes the necessity for physical
                        encounters between patients and physicians. Combined with the capabilities of remote
                        monitoring systems, a patient can be monitored using physiological sensors which seamlessly
                        gather data. Using an Internet of Things (IoT) model, non-invasive physiological sensors
                        that capture a patient's current health status can be exposed through a Telemedicine
                        platform. By closely monitoring patient's vital signs, physicians can capture a snapshot of
                        a patient's well being. This is an important factor in the lives of palliative care
                        patients, where focus is placed on quality of life.<br/><br/>This dissertation outlines a
                        secure, cloud-enabled Telemedicine solution aimed at the field of palliative medicine. This
                        dissertation plans to expose the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol in order to provide a multi-stream
                        data transmission protocol of low and high bit-rate data. Use of an adaptive data stream
                        enables efficient sensor traffic with capabilities of complex sensor data transmission in
                        emergency situations and low bandwidth data that can provide episodic updates. Each patient
                        sensor makes use of a gateway to transmit information to a cloud based service, which
                        publishes current and historic data for individual patients. Secure storage, access and
                        transmission of patient data is also an important concern. This dissertation outlines two
                        security mechanisms using a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography."<br/><br/></i>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The following is a high-level overview of the system architecture:</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/telemed_arch.jpg"
                         alt="Architecture diagram"/>
                    <br/>

                    <p>The prototype Bluetooth hardware is designed using a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and
                        Bluetooth Classic modules. <a href="http://redbearlab.com/bleshield/">RedBearLab's BLE
                            shield</a>provides all Bluetooth Low Energy functionality, while the <a
                                href="http://www.connectblue.com/products/wireless-ready-to-embed-modules/bluetooth-dual-mode-serial-port-module-obs421/">ConnectBlue
                            OBS421</a> chip provides Bluetooth Classic. Both chips are integrated using the <a
                                href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> platform (written in C), meaning that both
                        Bluetooth protocols can be used concurrently. Together, this hardware forms the basis for a
                        smart sensor that is capable of transmitting over low and high bit rate streams in parallel.
                        This ensures efficient and high throughput transmission of patient data.</p>

                    <p>The sensor gateway exposes the sensor streams to the cloud by routing the traffic securely
                        and efficiently by communicating both Bluetooth and IP (Internet Protocol). The gateway is
                        designed to function as a Bluetooth Smart Ready mobile phone.</p>

                    <p>The cloud application serves as a platform that provides data access to caregivers while also
                        leveraging control over the patient's remote sensor network. The technology behind the
                        application is industry standard - Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Bootstrap 3 to provide a
                        rich, secure, user interface (UI)-centric, and scalable application.</p>

                    <p>With close to a year spent in total at <a href="http://www.bullethq.com/">Bullet</a>, I
                        worked on many different parts of the Bullet Accounts product. As such a small startup at
                        the time, I worked closely with the CTO and was given a lot of responsibility.</p>

                    <p>In order to integrate with one of Ireland's largest online marketplaces
                        <a href="http://www.adverts.ie">Adverts.ie</a>, I designed and implemented <a
                                href="http://www.bullethq.com/api/v1/index">a RESTful API for the Bullet Accounts
                            product</a>. Another feature I developed was Bank Reconciliation (the process of
                        confirming the bank balance as shown in one's bank balancing statement and the corresponding
                        amount in an organisation's own accounting records). The feature allows a user to upload a
                        bank statement and the feature applies matching rules to each transaction so that they can
                        be reconciled with the information in Bullet. </p>

                    <p>Here's a screenshot taken from Bullet's transaction reconciliation process:</p>

                    <p>Death run is a multiplayer split screen game where players have to race each other to the top
                        of the slope whilst trying to avoid multiple different oncoming objects. The first player to
                        reach the top of the platform wins the game. I got inspiration for this game from the <a
                                href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/zombie-master">Zombie Master mod</a> for Half Life

                    <p>In the future I hope to work on adding a third player, whose role will be to manually control
                        the obstacles in order to prevent the other players from reaching the top. I also plan to
                        port the project to OpenGL ES so that the game can run on mobile devices.</p>
