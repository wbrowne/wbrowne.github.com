                    <p>MTT are a software company that specialize in mobile apps, mobile web and mobile technology
                        products for airlines, travel management companies, OTAs and hotels. They have customers such
                        as: EasyJet, Saudia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, BCD, and LATAM.</p>

                    <h4>Concierge Live</h4>

                    <p>MTT Concierge Live is a real-time mobile travel assistant that obtains a passenger's relevant
                        trip
                        information
                        in order to provide guidance through every step of the journey. Concierge Live exists as a
                        software widget
                        that is embedded within your existing mobile application.</p>

                    <p>As part of a small scrum product team, I assumed role as server side developer for the pilot of the Concierge Live Product.
                        Being part of MTT's product team meant that the components and services that we built had to be very
                        robust and maintainable. This meant that code reviews, architecture/design sessions, and pairing played a large role in our development processes.
                        My main responsibility for Concierge Live was building, configuring and maintaining Spring Boot web services.
                        Some of the main technologies used were Groovy, Spring Boot, Cucumber, Thymeleaf and MongoDB.</p>

                    <p>For more information on the product itself, please see MTT's press release on the <a

                        <h4>Automation Deployment (Ansible)</h4>

                        <p><a href="http://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a> is an automation platform used to provide provisioning,
                            deployment and configuration
                            management capabilities. Ansible provides functionality through scripts called <i>playbooks</i>.
                        </p>
                        In Ansible terms, a playbook is a list of <i>plays</i> where each <i>play</i> must contain:

                        <ul>
                            <li>A set of hosts (remote server instances) to configure</li>
                            <li>An ordered list of tasks to be executed on those hosts</li>
                        </ul>

                        As part of MTT my role at MTT I used Ansible to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provision AWS instances</li>
                            <li>Deploy products and components to the new instances</li>
                            <li>Setup a broker, AWS elbs and a DNS</li>
                            <li>Terminate environments</li>

                        <h2>Dissertation Telemedicine application</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p>The following is taken from the abstract section of my dissertation:</p>
                    <blockquote ><i>"Telemedicine is an important practice that removes the
                        necessity for
                        physical encounters between patients and physicians. Combined with the capabilities of remote
                        monitoring systems, a patient can be monitored using physiological sensors
                        which seamlessly gather data. Using an Internet of Things (IoT) model, non-invasive
                        physiological sensors that capture a patient's current health status can
                        be exposed through a Telemedicine platform. By closely monitoring patient's vital
                        signs, physicians can capture a snapshot of a patient's well being. This is an
                        important factor in the lives of palliative care patients, where focus is placed on
                        quality of life.<br/><br/>
                        This dissertation outlines a secure, cloud-enabled Telemedicine solution aimed at
                        the field of palliative medicine. This dissertation plans to expose the Bluetooth
                        4.0 protocol in order to provide a multi-stream data transmission protocol of low
                        and high bit-rate data. Use of an adaptive data stream enables efficient sensor
                        traffic with capabilities of complex sensor data transmission in emergency situations
                        and low bandwidth data that can provide episodic updates. Each patient
                        sensor makes use of a gateway to transmit information to a cloud based service,
                        which publishes current and historic data for individual patients. Secure storage,
                        access and transmission of patient data is also an important concern. This dissertation
                        outlines two security mechanisms using a combination of symmetric and
                        asymmetric cryptography."<br/><br/></i></blockquote>

                    <p>The following is a high-level overview of the system architecture:</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/img/telemed_arch.jpg"
                         alt="Architecture diagram"/>
                    <br/>

                    <p>The prototype Bluetooth hardware is designed using a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and
                        Bluetooth
                        Classic modules. <a href="http://redbearlab.com/bleshield/">RedBearLab's BLE shield</a> provides
                        all
                        Bluetooth Low Energy functionality, while the <a
                                href="http://www.connectblue.com/products/wireless-ready-to-embed-modules/bluetooth-dual-mode-serial-port-module-obs421/">ConnectBlue
                            OBS421</a> chip provides Bluetooth Classic. Both chips are integrated using the <a
                                href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> platform (written in C), meaning that both
                        Bluetooth
                        protocols can be used concurrently. Together, this hardware forms the basis for a smart sensor
                        that is
                        capable of transmitting over low and high bit rate streams in parallel. This ensures efficient
                        and high throughput transmission of patient data.</p>

                    <p>The sensor gateway exposes the sensor streams to the cloud by routing the traffic securely and
                        efficiently by
                        communicating both Bluetooth and IP (Internet Protocol). The gateway is designed to function as
                        a Bluetooth
                        Smart Ready mobile phone.</p>

                    <p>The cloud application serves as a platform that provides data access to caregivers while also
                        leveraging
                        control over the patient's remote sensor network. The technology behind the application is
                        industry standard
                        - Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Bootstrap 3 to provide a rich, secure, user interface
                        (UI)-centric, and
                        scalable application.</p>

                    <p>With a combined total of 10 months at <a href="http://www.bullethq.com/">Bullet</a>, I
                        worked on many
                        different parts of the Bullet Accounts product. As such a small startup at the time, I worked
                        closely with the CTO and was given a lot of responsibility.</p>

                    <p>In order to integrate with one of Ireland's largest online marketplaces
                        <a href="http://www.adverts.ie">Adverts.ie</a>, I designed and implemented a RESTful API for
                        the Bullet
                        Accounts product. Another feature I developed was Bank Reconciliation (the process of
                        confirming the bank balance as shown in one's bank balancing statement and the corresponding
                        amount in an organisation's own accounting records). The feature allows
                        a user to
                        upload a bank statement and the feature applies matching rules to each transaction so that they
                        can be reconciled with the information in Bullet. </p>

                    <p>Here's a screenshot taken from Bullet's transaction reconciliation process:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Death run is a multiplayer split screen game where players have to race each other to the top of
                        the slope
                        whilst trying to avoid multiple different oncoming objects. The first player to reach the top of
                        the
                        platform wins the game. I got inspiration for this game from the <a
                                href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/zombie-master">Zombie Master mod</a> for Half Life 2.

                    <p>In the future I hope to work on adding a third player, whose role will be to manually control the
                        obstacles
                        in order to prevent the other players from reaching the top. I also plan to port the project to
                        OpenGL ES so
                        that the game can run on mobile devices.</p>

                        by
                        integrating with NodeJS.</p>
